You can still install the Easysoft ODBC-SQL Server Driver but the 
installation will be unable to update the dynamic linker search paths 
or install the driver under the unixODBC Driver Manager (the latter is 
not necessary).  You may complete these processes manually by consulting 
the INSTALL file in the current directory.
